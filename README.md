# Healium
BfA update for Healium addon

To install:
1. Click the green 'Clone or download' button
2. Download the .zip.
3. Extract the .zip to a folder. This will be called 'Healium-master' by default.
4. Go to folder to your World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns and move the existing Healium folder somewhere else to keep as a backup copy.
6. Back in your Healium-master folder, there is a Healium folder. This is the folder you should copy over to your Addons folder.
7. Launch the game

NOTE:
I'm sorry that I'm not able to publish this to Twitch/Curse at the moment. I'm trying to get in touch with the original addon author to see if he or she is willing to incorporate my fixes into the official Healium addon, but I've not had any luck so far. I'll keep trying, though.

Because the addon author published Healium as 'all rights reserved,' Twitch/Curse will not host my version as a 'Healium Continued' or similar style continuation. I tried and they explicitly told me this, so unfortunately this repository will be the only source for these changes for the time being.

Please do file and bug reports or feature requests, and I'll take a look at them! When you do, please be as specific as possible and include screenshots if you're able. I don't actively use Healium myself, so I'm not as familiar with some of its intricacies or functionality as you guys who use it day to day. I'm happy to try to make fixes or improvements, but any help you can lend me is greatly appreciated.

One other note: while I'll do my best to keep this addon updated through further Blizzard API changes, I do have a job, family, and raid that come first for me, so please accept my apologies if your bug report or improvement request goes unseen for a bit. I'll do my best to get to it as soon as I'm able. Thanks!
