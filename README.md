# Healium
BfA update for Healium addon

To install:
1. Click the green 'Clone or download' button
2. Download the .zip.
3. Extract the .zip to a folder. This will be called 'Healium-master' by default.
4. Go to folder to your World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns and move the existing Healium folder somewhere else to keep as a backup copy.
6. Back in your Healium-master folder, there is a Healium folder. This is the folder you should copy over to your Addons folder.
7. Launch the game

NOTE:
I'm sorry that I'm not able to publish this to Twitch/Curse at the moment. I'm trying to get in touch with the original addon author to see if he or she is willing to incorporate my fixes into the official Healium addon, but I've not had any luck so far. I'll keep trying, though.

Because the addon author published Healium as 'all rights reserved,' I'm also not currently comfortable incorporating new functionality into the addon or publishing these fixes under a 'Healium Revived' or some other similar name and making it my own. Again, I'm trying to get the addon author's blessing for this but until I can, I'm only comfortable publishing the fixes to the existing addon here and leaving all credit to engypoo for the Healium addon.

Please do file and bug reports or feature requests, and I'll take a look at them!
